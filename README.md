# Walkersneps's website
Sources for my website, hosted at [https://sneps.xyz][3], on Github Pages at [http://ðŸš€ðŸŽˆ.tk][1], and on Keybase at [https://walkersneps.keybase.pub][2]

At the moment, [the first host][1] is recommended over [the second one][2], as [kbfs][kbfs article] is in alpha state of development and suffers frequent downtimes. I'll try to ensure authenticity of files on this repository by signing as many git commits as I can.
